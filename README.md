## Development environment

To get a local development copy running, you will need:

- [npm][], usually installed with [node][]
- [git][], version control tool

[git]: http://git-scm.com/
[npm]: http://npmjs.org/
[node]: http://nodejs.org/

Follow the steps below to get a development copy set up:

```bash
# Clone our repository
git clone https://github.com/vincelwt/harmony.git
cd harmony/

# Install our dependencies and dev dependencies

After running the above steps, a copy of Harmony should begin running.
