## Download

Download Harmony from the [website](https://getharmony.xyz/download).

## Reporting issues

Please indicate your operating system, Harmony's version and if you can, steps to reproduce the bug.

Altough you can submit small feature requests, keep in mind that I only prioritize requests coming from [paying users](https://getharmony.xyz/buy).

## Where is the source code?

Harmony used to be an open-source software. It is now a free-to-evaluate software, but you need a license for continued use.

I explain this decision [here](https://getharmony.xyz/buy).

You can still access the source code prior to the 0.5.0 release on this repo.
