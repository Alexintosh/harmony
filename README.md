Super simple Soundcloud player. Plays your music, nothing more, nothing less.

You don't even need to login.

## Instructions

####Complete the config.py file with:

**Your Soundcloud username:** the last part on your url. For example if your profile is http://soundcloud.com/coolusername, coolusername is your username.

**A valid SoundCloud API client_id** (you can find a lot by [searching Github](https://github.com/search?q=soundcloud+client_id&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93))

## Todo
* Cross-platform notifications (when a track is playing)
* Play all playlists (not only favorites)
* Error handling when no internet or invalid username
* Shuffle button
* Better icon
